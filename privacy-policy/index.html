        <p class="main__title">1. Introduction</p>
        <p class="main__text">
          We are Music Glue Limited (“we”, “our” and “us”) and we operate under
          the name of Venndr. “Sellers” use us to power their online stores and
          websites (our “Services”). Your privacy is important to us and we are
          committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. This Privacy
          Policy is intended to help you better understand how we collect, use
          and store your ”Personal Data” – defined as information that can be
          associated with or which relates to a person and/or could be used to
          identify a person.
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          Venndr collects and processes information on three main user groups:
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          1. Sellers (e.g. an artist who has created a Venndr-powered store)
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          2. Customers (e.g. a fan who buys something from an artist or venue
          via a Venndr-powered store)
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          3. Service Providers (e.g. a fulfilment service provider)
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          When you use or interact with us through the Services, we may collect
          Personal Data. Sometimes this will be on our own behalf and other
          times this will be on behalf of a Seller using our services. This is
          an important distinction for EU data protection law purposes and is
          explained in more detail in Section 15 below.
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          Venndr will never sell on your Personal Data to third parties and if
          you choose to consent to receiving marketing emails from Venndr you
          will be able to unsubscribe at any time. Please note that Venndr does
          not control the practices of its Sellers and it is their
          responsibility to follow all applicable data protection laws.
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          “Non-Personal Data” as used in this Privacy Policy is any information
          that does not relate to a person and/or cannot be used to identify a
          person. When you interact with the Services, we may collect
          Non-Personal Data. The limitations and requirements in this Privacy
          Policy on our collection, use, disclosure, transfer and
          storage/retention of Personal Data do not apply to Non-Personal Data.

          or Customers.

          Some Sellers may set customised fields at checkout requesting
          additional Personal Data from Customers. Venndr is not responsible for
          the content of the additional fields requested nor the Personal Data
          they collect. Sellers may use additional third party integrations on
          their sites, which is outside the control and responsibility of
          Venndr.

        <p class="main__title">3. How We Use Your Personal Data</p>
        <p class="main__text">
          We collect and use the Personal Data we collect in a manner that is
          consistent with this Privacy Policy. We may use the Personal Data as
          follows:
        </p>
        <p class="main__subtitle">3.1 Specific Reason.</p>
        <p class="main__text">
          If you provide Personal Data for a certain purpose, we may use the
          Personal Data in connection with the purpose for which it was
          provided. For instance, if you contact us by e-mail, we will use the
          Personal Data you provide to answer your question or resolve your
          problem and will respond to the email address from which the contact
          came.
        </p>
        <p class="main__subtitle">3.2 Access, Use and Provision of Services</p>
        <p class="main__text">
          If you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to or use of
          the Services or any functionality thereof, we will use your Personal
          Data to provide you with access to or use of the Services or
          functionality and to analyse your use of such Services or
          functionality. For instance, if you supply Personal Data relating to
          your identity to use certain portions of the Services, we will use
          that information to grant you access to use such Services. Similarly,
          if you supply Personal Data in the course of an ecommerce transaction,
          we will use that Personal Data to fulfil that transaction and supply
          you with the items/events you have purchased, or to help you to do so
          (such as via abandoned cart functionality).
        </p>
        <p class="main__subtitle">3.3 Internal Business Purposes.</p>
        <p class="main__text">
          We may use your Personal Data for internal business purposes,
          including without limitation, to help us improve the content and
          functionality of the Services, to better understand our Users, to
          improve the Services, to protect against, identify or address
          wrongdoing, to enforce our Terms of Service, to manage your account
          and provide you with customer service, and to generally manage the
          Services and our business.
        </p>
        <p class="main__subtitle">3.4 Marketing Communications.</p>
        <p class="main__text">
          You will only receive marketing emails from Venndr if you have opted
          in to receive them. We will make sure it is clear when you can make
          these choices, for example, we have boxes you need to select if you
          want to receive marketing at checkout. You will always be able to
          unsubscribe from any marketing emails from Venndr.
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          Venndr (or Sellers where applicable) may email you with reminders or
          warnings relating to your account or purchases, most commonly for the
          purposes of providing customer support.
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          If you are a Seller using Venndr’s services, we do not use the
          Personal Data we collect from you or your customers to independently
          contact or market to your customers. However, Venndr may contact or
          market to your customers if we obtain their information from another
          source, such as from the customers themselves. We may contact you, as
          a Seller, to inform you about our Services.
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          You can opt out at anytime by clicking “unsubscribe” in the email or
          by contacting
          <a href="mailto:support@musicglue.com">support@musicglue.com</a>.
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          Venndr provides a mailing list signup widget and sign up option at
          checkout for Sellers’ Customers to join the Seller’s mailing list. For
          example, if you are signing up to a mailing list for a band, it will
          state clearly who that band is. If you sign up for the band’s mailing
          list, that data will be passed to the band and it is then their
          responsibility to ensure they follow all data processing regulations.
          Venndr will not contact you for marketing purposes (unless you also
          join our mailing list).
        </p>
        <p class="main__subtitle">3.5 Other Purposes.</p>
        <p class="main__text">
          If we intend to use any Personal Data in any manner that is not
          consistent with this Privacy Policy, you will be informed of such
          anticipated use prior to or at the time the Personal Data is collected
          or we will obtain your consent subsequent to such collection but prior
          to such use.
        </p>
        <p class="main__subtitle">3.6 Aggregated Personal Data.</p>
        <p class="main__text">
          In an ongoing effort to understand and serve our Users better, we
          often conduct research on our customer demographics, interests and
          behaviour based on Personal Data and other information that we have
          collected. This research is typically conducted on an aggregate basis
          only that does not identify you. Once Personal Data is in an
          aggregated form, for purposes of this Privacy Policy, it becomes
          Non-Personal Data.

          4. How We Disclose And Transfer Your Personal Data
        </p>
        <p class="main__subtitle">4.1 No Sale.</p>
        <p class="main__text">
          We are not in the business of selling your Personal Data. We consider
          this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you.
          Therefore, we will not sell your Personal Data to third parties,
          including third party advertisers. There are, however, certain
          circumstances in which we may disclose, transfer or share your
          Personal Data with certain third parties without further notice to
          you, as set forth below.
        </p>
        <p class="main__subtitle">4.2 Business Transfers.</p>
        <p class="main__text">
          As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets.
          In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganisation, dissolution
          or similar event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets.
          You acknowledge and agree that any successor to or acquirer of Venndr
          (or its assets) will continue to have the right to use your Personal
          Data and other information in accordance with the terms of this
          Privacy Policy.

        <p class="main__subtitle">
          4.3 Parent Companies, Subsidiaries and Affiliates.
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          We may also share your Personal Data with our parent companies,
          subsidiaries and/or affiliates for purposes consistent with this
          Privacy Policy. Our parent companies, subsidiaries and affiliates will
          be bound to maintain that Personal Data in accordance with this
          Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <p class="main__subtitle">
          4.4 Agents, Consultants and Service Providers.
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          We may share your Personal Data with our contractors and service
          providers who process Personal Data on behalf of Venndr to perform
          certain business-related functions. These companies include fulfilment
          providers, payment processors, online chat and email providers, money
          transfer services, database service providers, backup and disaster
          recovery service providers and others. When we engage another company
          to perform such functions, we may provide them with information,
          including Personal Data, in connection with their performance of such
          functions.
        </p>
        <p class="main__subtitle">4.5 Sellers.</p>
        <p class="main__text">
          When transacting on Venndr, you are buying from a Seller that is
          typically an artist, one of their partners, or a music venue. The
          Seller is always displayed at checkout. Your Personal Information is
          shared with the Seller so that they can run their business, for
          example to fulfil your order, track sales activity, improve product
          and service offerings, plan tours and identify their top customers or
          customers with a certain purchase history. If you have bought a ticket
          from a Seller, they will likely share your details with the venue
          and/or promoter for the show, for example so that they can verify your
          ticket on the door list. If you have bought a physical item from a
          Seller, they will likely share your details with a fulfilment company,
          for example for sending you your order. If you would not like your
          data to be shared in this way please contact
          <a href="mailto:support@musicglue.com"></a> but please bear in mind it
          will likely impact your ability to use what you have purchased (for
          example, to attend the event in question if your details are not on
          the door list). If you have signed up to the Seller’s mailing list,
          they can contact you with news and announcements, for example
          announcing a new tour or album release, and they may analyse your
          sales history to target that effectively. Our Terms and Conditions
          provide that Sellers using our Services must comply with applicable
          laws when they use our Services. We are not responsible for the
          actions of Sellers with respect to your Personal Data.
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          Similarly, if you are a member of a Seller’s organisation within
          Venndr, your Personal Data will be available to the Seller and shared
          with third parties granted permission by the Seller to view all
          members of the Seller’s organisation.
        </p>
        <p class="main__subtitle">4.6 Legal Requirements.</p>
        <p class="main__text">
          We may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law in
          order to (for example) respond to a subpoena or request from law
          enforcement, a court or a government agency (including in response to
          public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement
          requirements), or in the good faith belief that such action is
          necessary to (a) comply with a legal obligation, (b) protect or defend
          our rights, interests or property or that of third parties, (c)
          prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the
          Services, (d) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal
          safety of Users of the Services or the public, or (e) protect against

          Venndr as a data controller and a data processor
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          EU data protection law makes a distinction between organisations that
          process Personal Data for their own purposes (known as “data
          controllers”) and organisations that process personal data on behalf
          of other organisations (known as “data processors”). If you have a
          question or complaint about how your Personal Data is handled, these
          should always be directed to the relevant data controller since they
          are the ones with primary responsibility for your Personal Data.
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          Venndr may act as either a data controller or a data processor in
          respect of your Personal Data, depending on the circumstances.
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          For example, if you create an account with us to power your ecommerce
          store (i.e. you are a Seller), Venndr will be a data controller in
          respect of the Personal Data that you provide as part of your account.
          We will also be a data controller of the Personal Data that we have
          obtained about the use of the services, which could relate to Sellers
          or Customers. We use this to conduct research and analysis to help
          better understand and serve Users of the Services as well as to
          improve our platform and provide you with more targeted
          recommendations about Services we think may be of interest to you.
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          However, if you interact with the Services as a Customer, we will
          process your Personal Data to help administer that order on behalf of
          the Seller (for example, sending confirmations, processing payments,
          etc.) and to help the Seller target, and understand the success of,
          their store and planning (for example, providing sales reports, using
          analytics to gain insights into the effectiveness of various sales
          channels, etc.). In these circumstances, Venndr merely provides the
          “tools” for Sellers; Venndr does not decide what Personal Data to
          analyse, nor is it responsible for the continued accuracy any Personal
          Data provided. We will pass any questions that you may have relating
          to your Personal Data and your rights under data protection law to the
          Seller as the data controller, in line with the terms of our Data
          Processing Addendum which forms part of our Terms and Conditions for

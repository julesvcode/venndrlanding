          supplier of certain services; and (b) the Direct Service is an online

        <ul>
          <ol>
            3.2.1 we will disclose to Customers on the basket page of the Direct
            Service your identity as the Seller of such Item;
          </ol>

            3.2.2 for any Item sale, the Customer is entering into a contract
            with you, not with Venndr, and you are responsible and liable to the
            Customer for fulfilling your obligations under that contract;
          </ol>
          <ol>

          <ol>
            3.2.4 Venndr does not act as a reseller or distributor and
            consequently, you do not sell the Item to Venndr and Venndr is not
            the seller of such Item to the Customer;
          </ol>
          <ol>
            3.2.5 Venndr collects service charges on Tickets directly from
            Customers and such amounts are disclosed to Customers as and
            additional amount payable to the price of the Ticket which is fixed
            by you;
          </ol>
          <ol>
            3.2.6 whilst Venndr may provide reasonable assistance to you to deal
            with queries and complaints from Customers, you hereby agree that
            Venndr is not responsible for directly handling such queries and
            complaints and such queries and complaints are solely to be handled
            by you;
          </ol>
          <ol>
            3.2.7 the Customer Terms and Conditions will, to the extent
            relevant, apply to the sale of any Item by you to a Customer and the

          </ol>
          <ol>
            3.2.8 you will not provide any other terms to the Customer (and no
            other such terms will apply); and

            3.2.9 you agree to abide and be bound by such Customer Terms and
            Conditions (which are available here).

          5.2 Revenue from sales of Items made through the Direct Service will
          be made “available” for payment to you in accordance with this clause
          5 after a period suitable for any complaints or issues to be raised

        </p>
        <ul>
          <ol>
            5.2.1 during any such period, the revenue will be held by us on

          <ol>
            5.2.6 Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this clause 5.2,
            Venndr may continue to withhold Pending Revenue (in excess of the
            periods set out in clauses 5.2.3, 5.2.4 and 5.2.5) where Venndr has
            received notice in any form (notwithstanding the provisions of
            clause 12.9) of any complaint or issue which will or is likely to
            effect the performance of this Agreement including, without
            limitation, our ability to pay you, until such complaint or issue is
            resolved to Venndr’s satisfaction. Such complaints or issues may
            relate to, without limitation, any alleged infringement of third
            party rights (including intellectual property rights), third party
            debtors, issues in connection with when and to whom such Pending
            Revenue should be paid by Venndr, disputes within the Seller’s
            organisation or between members of the Seller’s team or disputes
            between the Seller and its agents, advisers or other third parties
            along with matters relating to any freezing orders or other orders
            or judgements of a court or tribunal of competent authority.
          </ol>
        </ul>
        <p class="main__text">
          5.3 You agree that we may deduct from “available” revenue and retain
          commission on purchases of Items. We may change the level of
          commission on 30 days’ notice to you. Such commission will include a
          handling fee as set out at musicglue.com/pricing (or equivalent in
          foreign currencies). We may also retain any fees related to a bespoke
          website if you commission us to build one.
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          5.4 At the end of the pending period, we will provide a schedule
          showing the “available” revenue, and will pay such amounts, less our
          commission and fees (as set out in clause 5.3), to the bank account or
          PayPal account which you have previously designated to us via your
          Seller Account. You may designate a different bank or PayPal account
          by changing it on your Seller Account and giving us 20 days’ written
          notice. We shall not be obliged to make any payment of less than £20
          (or equivalent in foreign currencies) but shall hold over any amounts
          due until a payment of £20 or more is due.
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          5.5 In the event of Customer complaints regarding purchased Items,
          Venndr reserves the right to change the status of any sale to “under
          investigation” until the issue is resolved. We reserve the right to
          refund any or all Customers in full or in part, based on the Customer
          Terms & Conditions. If a refund occurs, you will not be paid for the
          sale or portion of the sale refunded and, if already paid for the
          same, we reserve the right to withhold the relevant amount from future
          payments. In relation to Customers’ rights to cancel contracts and
          claim refunds as set out in clause 6.1 of the Customer Terms and
          Conditions, such refunds shall be made to the relevant Customer(s)
          unless you can demonstrate to our reasonable satisfaction that no
          refund is due as a result of the date of cancellation being after the
          Customer’s right to cancel has expired. You will provide such
          information and assistance as is necessary for Customers to be able to
          exercise their rights to cancel. In addition, where refunds are made
          as a result of a claim initiated by a Customer and resolved in their
          favour by either the payment gateway or the customer’s bank, Venndr
          shall be entitled to withhold from amounts due to you, and to retain
          the charges levied by the Venndr payment gateways in making the refund
          payment.
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          5.6 Unless you specify prices in foreign currencies, all Items will be
          made available in all major currencies, converted using exchange rates
          set by Venndr as at the time of the relevant transaction(s). Any
          payments we make to you will be based on the base currency set for the
          relevant Item. Payments made from us to you will be made in the base
          currency of your account with us.
        </p>
        <p class="main__text">
          5.7 If you have not claimed any “available” revenue within 12 months
          of such revenue becoming “available”, you agree that Venndr shall be
          entitled to keep such sums and you hereby waive, to the fullest extent
          permitted by law, any claims, actions or similar that you may have to
          such sums.
